# Agent Threat Models

Reusable threat models for AI agents, tool-using LLM apps, RAG systems, and multi-agent workflows.

## Problem statement

Agent deployments often lack design-time security review. Reusable threat models help teams reason about assets, trust boundaries, tool permissions, failure modes, and monitoring before incidents happen.

## Why it matters

AI agents combine model reasoning with permissions, memory, retrieval, tools, and external data. That makes failures harder to reason about than ordinary prompt quality issues. Builders need practical, reviewable artifacts before deploying workflows that can read, write, call APIs, or act on behalf of users.

## Current status

Early-stage, defensive, work in progress. This repository is not a production security guarantee.

## What is included

- Single-agent tool-use model
- RAG agent model
- Multi-agent workflow model
- Memory-enabled agent model
- Reusable template and diagram notes

## Quick start

1. Read the README and responsible security note.
2. Start with the checklist or template closest to your system.
3. Adapt it to your own data, tools, permissions, and deployment context.
4. Open issues for gaps, unclear language, or safe examples you want added.

## Examples

Examples are synthetic and intentionally safe. They are designed to teach security thinking without enabling unauthorized activity against real systems.

## Roadmap

- Add diagrams
- Map threats to OWASP Agentic Top 10
- Add mitigations table
- Add review examples

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome if they are defensive, sourced where appropriate, and safe to publish. See CONTRIBUTING.md.

## Responsible security note

Do not use this repository to publish exploit code against real systems, credential theft, malware, stealth tooling, or instructions for unauthorized access.
